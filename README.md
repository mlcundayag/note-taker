# Express.js Challenge: Note Taker

## Description
In this challenge I created a note taker using ![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Express.js-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=express&logoColor=white) and the terminal. The note taker was able to take in user input and save it. Additionally, I added the delete function. 

I added a wildcard that redirects back to the landing page. The website can also access the api/notes which shows the input notes. 

Lastly, I deployed my webpage using heroku. 

I was able to successfully create a functioning note taker without errors.
